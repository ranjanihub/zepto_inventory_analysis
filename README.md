# 📦 Zepto Inventory Analysis using SQL

A data-driven inventory analysis project inspired by Zepto — a fast-growing quick-commerce startup. This project demonstrates real-world SQL skills applied to retail inventory datasets to derive actionable business insights.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to simulate how actual data analysts in the e-commerce or retail industries work behind the scenes to use SQL to:

✅ Set up a messy, real-world e-commerce inventory database
✅ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore product categories, availability, and pricing inconsistencies
✅ Implement Data Cleaning to handle null values, remove invalid entries, and convert pricing from paise to rupees
✅ Write business-driven SQL queries to derive insights around pricing, inventory, stock availability, revenue and more

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and was originally scraped from Zepto’s official product listings. It mimics what you’d typically encounter in a real-world e-commerce inventory system.

Each row represents a unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) for a product. Duplicate product names exist because the same product may appear multiple times in different package sizes, weights, discounts, or categories to improve visibility – exactly how real catalog data looks.

### 🧾 Columns:

* `sku_id`: Unique identifier for each product entry (Synthetic Primary Key)
* `name`: Product name as it appears on the app
* `category`: Product category like Fruits, Snacks, Beverages, etc.
* `mrp`: Maximum Retail Price (originally in paise, converted to ₹)
* `discountPercent`: Discount applied on MRP
* `discountedSellingPrice`: Final price after discount (also converted to ₹)
* `availableQuantity`: Units available in inventory
* `weightInGms`: Product weight in grams
* `outOfStock`: Boolean flag indicating stock availability
* `quantity`: Number of units per package (mixed with grams for loose produce)

## 🔧 Project Workflow

### 1. Database & Table Creation

We start by creating a SQL table with appropriate data types:

```sql
CREATE TABLE zepto (
  sku_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  category VARCHAR(120),
  name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
  mrp NUMERIC(8,2),
  discountPercent NUMERIC(5,2),
  availableQuantity INTEGER,
  discountedSellingPrice NUMERIC(8,2),
  weightInGms INTEGER,
  outOfStock BOOLEAN,
  quantity INTEGER
);
```

### 2. Data Import

Loaded CSV using pgAdmin's import feature.

If you're not able to use the import feature, write this code instead:

```sql
\copy zepto(category,name,mrp,discountPercent,availableQuantity,
            discountedSellingPrice,weightInGms,outOfStock,quantity)
  FROM 'data/zepto_v2.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', QUOTE '"', ENCODING 'UTF8');
```

Faced encoding issues (UTF-8 error), which were fixed by saving the CSV file using CSV UTF-8 format.

### 3. 🔍 Data Exploration

* Counted the total number of records in the dataset
* Viewed a sample of the dataset to understand structure and content
* Checked for null values across all columns
* Identified distinct product categories available in the dataset
* Compared in-stock vs out-of-stock product counts
* Detected products present multiple times, representing different SKUs

### 4. 🧹 Data Cleaning

* Identified and removed rows where MRP or discounted selling price was zero
* Converted `mrp` and `discountedSellingPrice` from paise to rupees for consistency and readability

### 5. 📊 Business Insights

* Found top 10 best-value products based on discount percentage
* Identified high-MRP products that are currently out of stock
* Estimated potential revenue for each product category
* Filtered expensive products (MRP > ₹500) with minimal discount
* Ranked top 5 categories offering highest average discounts
* Calculated price per gram to identify value-for-money products
* Grouped products based on weight into Low, Medium, and Bulk categories
* Measured total inventory weight per product category

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Overview

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes:

* KPIs: Total Quantity, Available Quantity, Average Discount
* Bar Chart: Quantity by Category
* Pie Chart: Top 5 Products by Quantity
* Donut Chart: Category-wise Discount Percent
* Line Chart: Total Revenue vs Discount by Category
* Area Chart: Product Weight by Name
* Slicers: Category, Out-of-Stock filters
