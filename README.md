# üì¶ Zepto Inventory Analysis using SQL

A data-driven inventory analysis project inspired by Zepto ‚Äî a fast-growing quick-commerce startup. This project demonstrates real-world SQL skills applied to retail inventory datasets to derive actionable business insights.

---

## üìå Project Overview

The goal is to simulate how actual data analysts in the e-commerce or retail industries work behind the scenes to use SQL to:

‚úÖ Set up a messy, real-world e-commerce inventory database
‚úÖ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore product categories, availability, and pricing inconsistencies
‚úÖ Implement Data Cleaning to handle null values, remove invalid entries, and convert pricing from paise to rupees
‚úÖ Write business-driven SQL queries to derive insights around pricing, inventory, stock availability, revenue and more

## üìÅ Dataset Overview

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and was originally scraped from Zepto‚Äôs official product listings. It mimics what you‚Äôd typically encounter in a real-world e-commerce inventory system.

Each row represents a unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) for a product. Duplicate product names exist because the same product may appear multiple times in different package sizes, weights, discounts, or categories to improve visibility ‚Äì exactly how real catalog data looks.

### üßæ Columns:

* `sku_id`: Unique identifier for each product entry (Synthetic Primary Key)
* `name`: Product name as it appears on the app
* `category`: Product category like Fruits, Snacks, Beverages, etc.
* `mrp`: Maximum Retail Price (originally in paise, converted to ‚Çπ)
* `discountPercent`: Discount applied on MRP
* `discountedSellingPrice`: Final price after discount (also converted to ‚Çπ)
* `availableQuantity`: Units available in inventory
* `weightInGms`: Product weight in grams
* `outOfStock`: Boolean flag indicating stock availability
* `quantity`: Number of units per package (mixed with grams for loose produce)

## üîß Project Workflow

### 1. Database & Table Creation

We start by creating a SQL table with appropriate data types:

```sql
CREATE TABLE zepto (
  sku_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  category VARCHAR(120),
  name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
  mrp NUMERIC(8,2),
  discountPercent NUMERIC(5,2),
  availableQuantity INTEGER,
  discountedSellingPrice NUMERIC(8,2),
  weightInGms INTEGER,
  outOfStock BOOLEAN,
  quantity INTEGER
);
```

### 2. Data Import

Loaded CSV using pgAdmin's import feature.

If you're not able to use the import feature, write this code instead:

```sql
\copy zepto(category,name,mrp,discountPercent,availableQuantity,
            discountedSellingPrice,weightInGms,outOfStock,quantity)
  FROM 'data/zepto_v2.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', QUOTE '"', ENCODING 'UTF8');
```

Faced encoding issues (UTF-8 error), which were fixed by saving the CSV file using CSV UTF-8 format.

### 3. üîç Data Exploration

* Counted the total number of records in the dataset
* Viewed a sample of the dataset to understand structure and content
* Checked for null values across all columns
* Identified distinct product categories available in the dataset
* Compared in-stock vs out-of-stock product counts
* Detected products present multiple times, representing different SKUs

### 4. üßπ Data Cleaning

* Identified and removed rows where MRP or discounted selling price was zero
* Converted `mrp` and `discountedSellingPrice` from paise to rupees for consistency and readability

### 5. üìä Business Insights

* Found top 10 best-value products based on discount percentage
* Identified high-MRP products that are currently out of stock
* Estimated potential revenue for each product category
* Filtered expensive products (MRP > ‚Çπ500) with minimal discount
* Ranked top 5 categories offering highest average discounts
* Calculated price per gram to identify value-for-money products
* Grouped products based on weight into Low, Medium, and Bulk categories
* Measured total inventory weight per product category
